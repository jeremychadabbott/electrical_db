uploading old folder structure. It's messy. Looking forward to creating correct repository folder strcuture. database links. Ideally, a webserver to dish out the info.
due to API restrictions, a lot of this was intially created in VBA and utilized an outlook script to connet to a flat file and send responses back via email.
The goal is to recreate this with python wescraping, SQL database, webserver and ideally, web interaction with the SQL database as a feature project
and to give me a project where I will learn all the aspects of front end and back end
