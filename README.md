Uploading old folder structure. It's messy. Looking forward to creating the correct repository folder structure and database links. Ideally, a web server to dish out the info.

Due to API restrictions, a lot of this was initially created in VBA and utilized an Outlook script to connect to a flat file and send responses back via email.

The goal is to recreate this with Python web scraping, an SQL database, a web server, and ideally, web interaction with the SQL database as a feature project, giving me a project where I will learn all the aspects of front end and back end development.
